### Description
<br>
AGCoffee Ratio  app made to help home brewers brew their coffee by calculating a the grams of water needed, and run a timer all in the same screen.
<br>
With the addition of the segmented control: When you are in Grams mode, the number you enter into the big box is coffee in grams and the large output is the water in grams.
<br>
When you are in TBSP mode, the number you enter into the big box is coffee in tablespoons and the large output is water in cups.
<br>
The bottom right box (18.5 is the default Grams value) is amount of water for coffee:water ratio So when you are in Grams mode, you get a 1:18.5 ratio and the water amount is changeable. I personally use 1:16.8
<br>
When you are in TBSP mode, You get a 1:0.375 ratio which is 1 TBSP to 0.375 cups of water ratio. This is also changeable.
<br>
This is perfect for:
<br>
Chemex
<br>
French Press
<br>
V60
<br>
Drip Pot
<br>
other slow bar methods
